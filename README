Hooks for J to talk to libFLANN.

Tested with fresh libFLANN 1.8.4 build. 
Doesn't work with the Ubuntu version of the library.

It assumes you have libflann compiled and in /usr/local/lib/
libFLANN is available here:

TODO: save trees, load trees, float and other data type trees for 
memory efficiency. Get rid of "flann_stubs.ijs"
Also, round out the test script for more coverage.
