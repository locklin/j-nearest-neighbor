Hooks for J to talk to libFLANN.

This should presently be considered "broken" until more features have been tested.
It does, however, work, when you feed it the right set of parameters. FLANN is pretty effective: I'm impressed. 
It assumes you have libflann compiled and in your temp directory (why doesn't J look in /usr/local/lib? it is 
a mystery!).

If you don't have a favorite set of near neighbors to test:

load'flann.ijs'
floatrand=: ?@$ % ] - 1:
dataset=: 1E5 10 $ 10e3 floatrand 100 NB. note where the near neighbors will be in this create
test=: 1E3 10 $ 1e4 floatrand 100
((1;2.2-2.2) setparams 'typetree';'eps') allsearch dataset;test;3

I would also like to have the ability to query pre-created trees, using the commented out functions in this script
(aka buildtree and searchtree). So far, the functions using pre-sorted trees don't work. I have no idea what J 
does to raw pointers like that, or for that matter, if FLANN is allocating on the stack or something weird like that.

There are several other spatial trees in C which I have been attempting to get to function reliably; I'll stick them 
in here as I get them working.
