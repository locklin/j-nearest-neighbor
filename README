Hooks for J to talk to libFLANN.

Tested with fresh libFLANN 1.8.4 build. 
Doesn't work with the Ubuntu version of the library.

It assumes you have libflann compiled and in your temp directory
FLANN is pretty effective: I'm impressed. 

If you don't have a favorite set of near neighbors to test:

load'flann.ijs'
floatrand=: ?@$ % ] - 1:
dataset=: 1E5 10 $ 10e3 floatrand 100 
test=: 1E3 10 $ 1e4 floatrand 100
((1;2.2-2.2) setparams 'typetree';'eps') allsearch dataset;test;3

To query preallocated trees:

tree=: buildtree dataset
searchtree tree;test
choptree tree NB. don't forget to deallocate!

I haven't fully tested the deallocator, though it appears to work. There may be 
a small memory leak in deallocating the constructor struct

TODO: save trees, load trees, float and other data type trees for memory efficiency.

There are several other spatial trees in C which I have been attempting to get 
to function reliably; I'll stick them in here as I get them working.
